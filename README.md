Group project for the course 02322 Machine-oriented programming at The Technical University of Denmark.

The project is a collection of subroutines which, when put together in Projekt1_Opg5.asm form a simple program,
that reads a positive integer of up to 5 digits from the console and determines whether it is a prime.

The program is written in LC-3 assembly.
